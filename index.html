<title>Ludum Dare 31 - Interception</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
  This is a Micro-Jam game - I worked on it for ~5 hours (exclusive the initial idea).<br/>
  It&apos;s a 4 player team game (2 vs. 2) that can be described as a very minimalistic football game.
</p>
<p>
  Use eighter 4 PS3 controllers (left stick is used), or remap the controls in the standard unity interface. (e.g. shared controller).<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Remark: I only have one controller at hand, and I could not test the gameplay with other people, so I have no idea how fun it is gameplay wise :D
