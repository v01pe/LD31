<title>Ludum Dare 31 - Interception</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
  This is a Micro-Jam game - I worked on it for ~5 hours (exclusive the initial idea).<br/>
  It&apos;s a 4 player team game (2 vs 2) that can be described as a very minimalistic football game.
</p>
<p>
  You have to pick up the ball, then point toward where you want to throw it (only you know the direction). Blue and purple are team 1, yellow and orange are team 2. Throw the ball in the end-zone and pick it up there -> touchdown. There is no end condition.
</p>
<p>
  Use eighter 4 PS3 controllers (left stick is used), or remap the controls in the standard unity interface (e.g. shared controller).<br/>
</p>
<p>
  Remark: I only had one controller at hand, and I could not test the gameplay with other people, so I have no idea how fun the gameplay is :D
